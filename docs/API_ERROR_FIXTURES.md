# API Error Fixtures Intake

This document defines how to collect and maintain real-world App Store Connect API error payloads for regression tests.

## Why This Exists

Apple error responses can include useful fields under flexible `meta` payloads (for example, `meta.associatedErrors`). These fields are not strictly modeled in the OpenAPI schema and can change over time.

A fixture corpus helps us catch parser and UX regressions before they reach users.

## Source of Payload Variants

Use one or more of the following:

- User reports in GitHub Issues (preferred for real production failures)
- Maintainer reproduction in throwaway ASC test apps
- Integration test runs that intentionally trigger known validation/state failures

When opening an issue, use the `API Error Payload Report` template so data is complete and sanitized.

## Required Data for Each Fixture

Collect these fields:

- `asc` version
- CLI command (exact invocation)
- HTTP status code
- Full sanitized JSON error body from ASC

Optional but useful:

- Endpoint path (if known)
- Expected CLI output behavior
- Reproduction notes

## Sanitization Rules

Before committing or sharing payloads:

- Remove/redact app IDs, version IDs, submission IDs, and other resource identifiers
- Remove/redact emails, names, free-form user text, and team/vendor identifiers
- Never include tokens, private keys, JWTs, headers, cookies, or credentials
- Keep structure and error wording intact so parser behavior remains realistic

Use placeholders like `app-<redacted>` or `version-<redacted>` instead of deleting keys.

## Fixture Storage Convention

Store fixtures under:

- `internal/asc/testdata/error_payloads/`

Naming pattern:

- `<status>-<area>-<scenario>.json`
- Example: `409-review-associated-errors-missing-age-rating.json`

Fixture content should be the raw ASC error response body JSON object, not wrapped in extra metadata.

## Test Coverage Expectations

For each new fixture variant:

- Add/extend parser tests in `internal/asc/client_test.go`
- Assert both parsed structure and rendered error message content
- Add command-level coverage in `internal/cli/cmdtest/` when user-facing formatting matters
- Keep malformed-shape coverage to ensure graceful fallback behavior

## Maintenance

- Prefer adding new fixtures over changing existing fixtures unless the old one is invalid
- Keep fixtures small, focused, and scenario-specific
- If a fixture required aggressive redaction, include a short note in the related test explaining any intentional placeholder content
